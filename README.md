Cleans nginx's fastcgi/proxy cache or redis-cache whenever a post is edited/published. Also does a few more things.

## Description ##

1. Removes `index.php` from permalinks when using WordPress with nginx.
1. Adds support for purging redis-cache when used as full-page cache created using [nginx-srcache-module](https://github.com/openresty/srcache-nginx-module#caching-with-redis)
1. Adds support for nginx fastcgi_cache_purge & proxy_cache_purge directive from [module](https://github.com/FRiCKLE/ngx_cache_purge "ngx_cache_purge module"). Provides settings so you can customize purging rules.
1. Adds support for nginx `map{..}` on a WordPress-multisite network installation. Using it, Nginx can serve PHP file uploads even if PHP/MySQL crashes. Please check the tutorial list below for related Nginx configurations.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

**Important** - Please refer to [https://easyengine.io/nginx-helper/faq](https://easyengine.io/nginx-helper/faq) for up-to-date FAQs.

### FAQ - Installation/Comptability ###

**Q. Will this work out of the box?**

No. You need to make some changes at the Nginx end. Please check our [tutorial list](https://easyengine.io/wordpress-nginx/tutorials/).

### FAQ - Nginx Fastcgi Cache Purge ###

**Q. There's a 'purge all' button? Does it purge the whole site?**

Yes, it does. It physically empties the cache directory. It is set by default to `/var/run/nginx-cache/`.

If your cache directory is different, you can override this in your wp-config.php by adding
`define('RT_WP_NGINX_HELPER_CACHE_PATH','/var/run/nginx-cache/');`
or override this in the plugin settings. Settings in wp-config.php take precedence over plugin setting.

Replace the path with your own.

**Q. Does it work for custom posts and taxonomies?**

Yes. It handles all post-types the same way.

**Q. How do I know my Nginx config is correct for fastcgi purging?**

Manually purging any page from the cache, by following instructions in the previous answer.

Version 1.3.4 onwards, Nginx Helper adds a comment at the end of the HTML source ('view source' in your favourite browser):
`&lt;!--Cached using Nginx-Helper on 2012-10-08 07:01:45. It took 42 queries executed in 0.280 seconds.--&gt;`. This shows the time when the page was last cached. This date/time will be reset whenever this page is purged and refreshed in the cache. Just check this comment before and after a manual purge.

As long as you don't purge the page (or make changes that purge it from the cache), the timestamp will remain as is, even if you keep refreshing the page. This means the page was served from the cache and it's working!

The rest shows you the database queries and time saved on loading this page. (This would have been the additional resource load, if you weren't using fast-cgi-cache.)


**Q. I need to flush a cached page immediately! How do I do that?**

Nginx helper plugin handles usual scenarios, when a page in the cache will need purging. For example, when a post is edited or a comment is approved on a post.

To purge a page immediately, follow these instructions:

* Let's say we have a page at the following domain: http://yoursite.com/about.
* Between the domain name and the rest of the URL, insert '/purge/'.
* So, in the above example, the purge URL will be http://yoursite.com/purge/about.
* Just open this in a browser and the page will be purged instantly.
* Needless to say, this won't work, if you have a page or taxonomy called 'purge'.


### FAQ - Nginx Map ###

**Q. My multisite already uses `WPMU_ACCEL_REDIRECT`. Do I still need Nginx Map?**

Definitely. `WPMU_ACCEL_REDIRECT` reduces the load on PHP, but it still ask WordPress i.e. PHP/MySQL to do some work for static files e.g. images in your post. Nginx map lets nginx handle files on its own bypassing wordpress which gives you much better performance without using a CDN.

**Q. I am using X plugin. Will it work on Nginx?**

Most likely yes. A wordpress plugin, if not using explicitly any Apache-only mod, should work on Nginx. Some plugin may need some extra work.
